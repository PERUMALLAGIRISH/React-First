	Arrow fucntions for event handling.

	React application would comprise on a list of components.

	props = Every React Component, JS object and pass data to other components

	props = READOnly 

	state = Data that is local / private to the component
	other components cannot access the state.

	Component Life Cycle:

	1. Mount
		instance of the component is created and inserted into the DOM

		constructor
		render .  React gets its vitrual DOM and renders with Actual DOM
		componentDidMount

	When the component is rendered, its children are also rendered.
